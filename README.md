# AdaptiveTubePlanning
Repository for developing planning-tracking methodologies where aggressiveness of the planning model can be traded off in real time for accuracy of the tracking performance.

For now, @Cole work in the DeepReach folder. Write code however you feel comfortable, I can work with you to use some of these wandb/hydra tools later when we start running experiments. 
The environment.yaml will allow us to maintain constistency of package versions. You should be able to create an environment from the yaml file (I forgot how to make this minimal, will try to fix soon.)
